# Release v0.2.0
Welcome to the version 0.2.0 release of the pqc-evaluation-tools project!

## Release Description 
### Overview
This release updates the pqc-evaluation-tools benchmark suite to utilise the most recent versions of the OQS project's PQC implementations. Including, the latest algorithms supported by Liboqs, the use of the improved OQS-Provider library compared to the previous OQS-OpenSSL library, and support for the testing and parsing of Hybrid-PQC algorithms within TLS. This version also improves the general setup of the suite alongside various optimisations and condensing of automation script files.

### Features
The project provides automation for:

- Compiling and configuration of the OQS, ARM PMU, and OpenSSL dependency libraries.

- Gathering PQC computational performance data, including CPU and memory usage metrics using the Liboqs library.

- Gathering Networking performance data for the integration of PQC schemes in the TLS 1.3  protocol by utilising the OpenSSL 3.2.1 and OQS-Provider libraries.

- Coordinated testing of PQC TLS handshakes using either the loopback interface or a physical network connection between a server and client device.

- Parsing of the PQC performance data, where data from multiple machines can be parsed, averaged, and then compared against each other.

## Known Issues

- Manual copying of generated certificate and private key files for the TLS performance benchmarks required.
  
- Limited support for system architectures and operating systems.
  
- Issue with gathering full memory usage metrics for the Falcon Algorithm on ARM devices.

## Important Notes
 - This is an early version of the project, functionality is limited to x86 Linux devices and Raspberry Pis. However, future updates will address this issue.
  
- Activating the automated tools will delete all results currently stored in the up-results directory. To retain previous results, these should be moved to another location prior to re-running the automated test tool.

We look forward to your feedback and contributions to this project!
