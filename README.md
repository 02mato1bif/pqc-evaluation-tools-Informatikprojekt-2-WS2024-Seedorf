This is the **development branch**, it may not be in a fully functioning state and documentation may still need updated. The checkboxes below indicates whether the current development version is in a basic functioning state and if the documentation is accurate for its current functionality. Regardless please keep this in mind and use the main branch if possible, thank you.

- [x] Functioning State*
- [x] Up to date documentation

> *Dev branch Notice: Current functioning state works for both x86 and ARM machines. However, on ARM devices, memory profiling for Falcon algorithm variations is non-functioning. Please refer to [bug-report-on-liboqs-repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1761) for more details. Work is underway to resolve this issue but for now the repository has methods in place to account for this. Automated testing and parsing scripts can still be used to gather performance metrics for all other algorithms on ARM systems.

## Overview

**Version 0.2.0**

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an expanding field which aims to address the security concerns that quantum computers will bring to current cryptographic technologies. Numerous PQC schemes have been proposed to help combat this concern, with each offering differing solutions. 

This repository provides tools that will simplify the process for the gathering and parsing of PQC computational performance data. It includes scripts that will automate the building process, the testing process, and the result parsing process. The final output from these tools is CSV files, containing performance metrics alongside metric averages that can be further used for graph generation. For more information on the tools, please refer to the [Repository Structure](#repository-structure) section.

At the current moment, the repository provides automation in PQC performance testing by integrating tools created by the [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/) project using their **Liboqs** and **OQS-Provider libraries** into performance evaluation scripts. Furthermore, it provides an automated and robust way in which to gather network performance testing using physical networks. Going forward, this project aims to incorporate other PQC libraries present in the field, alongside performance testing of other cryptographic systems such as homomorphic encryption. The project aims to provide a cross-platform method of evaluating these systems on multiple systems ranging from standard desktop devices to IoT devices.

The testing scripts allow for the evaluation of all algorithms supported by Liboqs version 0.10.0 alongside the evaluation of both PQC only and PQC-Hybrid schemes in TLS exchanges to allow for an extensive assessment of the performance of PQC solutions on the system the repository is ran on. 

> Notice: At the current moment, due to how directory paths variables are handled by the scripts in the project, all scripts must be executed from the directory that stored in. This issue will be addressed in following version of the project.

## Supported Hardware and Software

### Compatible Hardware and Operating Systems <!-- omit from toc --> 
The automated testing tool is currently only supported on the following devices:

- x86 Linux Machines using Debian based distros
- ARM Linux devices using a 64-bit Operating System

> Notice: Current functioning state works for both x86 and ARM machines. However, on ARM devices, memory profiling for Falcon algorithm variations is non-functioning. Please refer to [bug-report-on-liboqs-repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1761) for more details. Work is underway to resolve this issue but for now the repository has methods in place to account for this. Automated testing and parsing scripts can still be used to gather performance metrics for all other algorithms on ARM systems.

### Tested Dependency Software <!-- omit from toc --> 
This version of the repository has been fully tested using the following versions of the dependency libraries:

- Liboqs Version 0.10.0

- OQS Provider Version 0.6.1

- OpenSSL Version 3.2.1

The automated setup scripts are designed to pull the latest versions of the OQS libraries and dynamically handle algorithm changes in order to provide performance analysis for the currently supported PQC algorithms. If there are any issues with the latest dependency versions, details on how to handle this can be found in the [OQS Version Issue Handling](#oqs-version-issue-handling) section.

## Installation Instructions

Clone the current stable version:
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/crt26/pqc-eval-tools.git
```

Move into the cloned repository directory and execute the setup script:
```
cd pqc-eval-tools
./setup
```

You may need to change the permissions of the setup script, if that is the case, the setup can be done using the following commands:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### Select which OQS benchmarking libraries should be setup:
When executing the setup script, you will be presented with three options:

1. Build only the liboqs library (used for only testing PQC performance)

2. Build both the liboqs and OQS-Provider libraries (used for testing both PQC performance and PQC in TLS performance) 

3. Build the OQS-Provider Library after a previous install of Liboqs


The setup script will also handle the building of [OpenSSL 3.2.1](https://www.openssl.org/source/) within the pqc-eval-tools lib directory as this is required to utilise the OpenSSL provider functionality provided by OQS-Provider. This will be a separate build from the systems default OpenSSL installation and will not replace or interfere with those binaries.

Once all of the relevant options have been selected, the setup script will download, configure and build each of the libraries. Alongside, optimizing the builds for the current systems by automatically passing the relevant build parameters.

## Automated Testing Tools

### Tools Description
There are two sets of automated testing that can be done using these tools:

- PQC performance benchmarking using Liboqs
- PQC integration into TLS performance benchmarking using OQS-Provider

The testing tools can be found within the `scripts/test-scripts` directory and are fully automated. The tools allow multiple machines to be tested, with results being assigned a number set at the beginning of the test. The testing scripts are as follows:

### Liboqs Performance Testing

This script automates the CPU and memory performance benchmarking of various PQC algorithms included in the liboqs library. It generates and records comprehensive metrics which can help in analysing the performance of these algorithms. 

The test script can be executed using the following command:
```
./full-liboqs-test.sh
```

#### Detailed usage instructions can be found using the following link:

[liboqs Performance Automated Testing Instructions](docs/testing-tools-documentation/liboqs-performance-testing.md)

### OQS-Provider Performance Testing

This script is focused on benchmarking the performance of PQC and PQC-Hybrid algorithms when integrated within the OpenSSL (3.2.1) library via the OQS-Provider. The script firstly can test the computational efficiency of the PQC algorithms when integrated into the OpenSSL library. Alongside, how PQC/PQC-Hybrid algorithms perform when integrated into the TLS protocol by measuring empty TLS handshake performance. Furthermore, metrics for how classic algorithms perform when conducting the TLS handshake to gather data which can be used as a baseline to compare the PQC metrics against.   

The testing tool allows for tests to be conducted on a single machine or using two machine connected via a physical network. It should be noted that when using two physical machines the complexity of setup increases. However, regardless of which scenario, the process requires more additional steps then the liboqs testing.

#### Detailed usage instructions can be found using the following link:

[PQC TLS Performance Automated Testing Instructions](docs/testing-tools-documentation/tls-performance-testing.md)


### Testing Output Files
After selecting the desired testing script, the performance benchmarks will be performed and the unparsed results will be stored in the newly created ``test-data/up-results`` directory. Liboqs unparsed results will be stored in the `test-data/up-results/liboqs/machine-x`* directory. The PQC TLS test results will be stored in the `test-data/up-results/oqs-openssl/machine-x`* directory.

**The Machine-ID number assigned to the test*


## Parsing Test Results

### Parsing Overview

The results from the automated tests can be transformed into workable CSV files using the `parse_results.py` script located in the `scripts/parsing-scripts` directory. Options are provided to parse the liboqs results, the OQS-Provider results, or both.

The script requires the test parameters used during the benchmarking, including the number of runs and number of machines tested, if multiple machine results have been stored within the `test-data/up-results` directory. Please make sure all up-results are present in this directory that you wish to be parsed before executing the `parse_results.py` script.


### Parsing Script Usage

The parsing process, unlike the testing scripts, can be executed on both Linux and Windows machines. If you're parsing results from multiple machines, make sure all results are present in the `up-results` directory. Execute the parsing script with the following commands depending on the default Python command alias:

```
python3 parse_results.py
```


### Parsed Results Output
At the end of the process, the results will be stored within the newly created **results** directory which can be found in the results folder at `test-data/results`. Averages for the results will also be calculated during the parsing process and the average files for the respective test type can be found within the same results directory.

### Graph Generation
The results files outputted from the parsing scripts can be used with Microsoft Excel, Python, R-Studio etc. for the creation of graphs, helpful links for data visualisation can be found below:

## Utility Scripts
The utility scripts provided may be useful when developing or testing using the various scripts contained in the repository or when setting up performance testing environments. More refined and encompassing utility scripts will be added as the project progresses. All utility scripts bar the `uninstall.sh` script can be found in the `scripts/utility-scripts` directory. The only exception to the is the `cleaner.sh` script which is stored at the projects root for easy access and uninstalling.

The current set of utility scripts includes:

### cleaner.sh <!-- omit from toc --> 
This is a utility script for cleaning the various project files produced from the compiling and benchmarking operations. The script provides functionality for either uninstalling the OQS-OpenSSL libraries from the system, clearing the old results and generated TLS keys, or both. When selecting the uninstalling option, the script will remove the liboqs, OQS-Provider, and OpenSSL 3.2.1 libraries from the system. When selecting the clearing the old results and keys option, the script will remove the old test results and generated keys directories from the test-data directory.

### get_algorithms.py <!-- omit from toc --> 
This is a Python utility script which is used to dynamically determine the algorithms which are supported by the version of Liboqs and OQS-Provider libraries installed. These are then outputted accordingly to the `test-data/alg-lists` text files for the different algorithm and test types. The main usage of the script is to be called from the `setup.sh` script where it is passed an argument which dictates which install type is being performed in the setup process. There is also the option to call the `get_algorithms.py` manually to create the algorithm list files if required. However, this script must be ran from the `scripts/utility-scripts` directory. 

Based on the the install type that has been selected in the main setup script, the following integer arguments can be supplied to the utility script:

- 1 - (Liboqs only)
- 2 - (Liboqs and OQS-Provider)
- 3 - (OQS-Provider only)


Example usage when running manually:
```
cd scripts/utility-scripts
python3 get_algorithms.py 1
```

### configure-openssl-cnf.sh <!-- omit from toc --> 
This script can change the configurations added to the OpenSSL 3.2.1 configuration file by commenting or uncommenting the lines which set what default groups OpenSSL uses. This is needed to allow both the `oqsssl-generate-keys.sh` and the TLS performance testing scripts to operate correctly. This script is mainly used by the automated scripts, however it can be called manually using the following commands:

**configure-openssl-cnf.sh - Comment out Default Group Configurations:**
```
./configure-openssl-cnf.sh 0
```

**configure-openssl-cnf.sh - Uncomment out Default Group Configurations:**
```
./configure-openssl-cnf.sh 1
```

> Notice: As the `configure-openssl-cnf.sh` script is intended mainly to be used by the automated testing scripts, please take caution when calling the script manually. This is due to how the script anticipates the state of the configuration file. If calling manually ensure to verify the openssl.cnf file for any double comments or other misconfigurations.



## Repository Structure
The repository will contain default directories present when cloned and during operation will create various directories required for its functionality. Directories created by the scripts shown in the following directory structure will be marked with a "*".

## OQS Version Issue Handling
The repository is currently setup to pull the latest versions of the OQS projects and maintain use of the listed OpenSSL version to ensure the latest available algorithms can be tested. Handling has been implemented to accommodate for any changes to the algorithms that are supported by the OQS libraries as newer versions are released. 

**However, as the OQS libraries are still developing projects, if any major changes have occurred to their code bases and this project's scripts does not accommodate this, please report an issue to this repositories GitHub page.**

The issue will be resolved ASAP and in the meantime, it is possible to change the URL used for the git clones in the `setup.sh` script so that the latest tested versions can be installed instead. These can found at the following lines in the main setup script at the projects root:

- **Liboqs Setup** - Line 308
- **OQS-Provider Setup** - Line 369

By reporting this issue, you would be helping ensure that the tool is fully functioning and able to provide the most up to date PQC performance data for yourself and other researchers who may be utilising this benchmarking suite. Reporting any issues with the latest versions of the OQS libraries will be greatly appreciated :)

> Notice: Future versions of this repository will add functionality for providing this temporary fix option to the user in the event of the latest version not functioning. Removing the need for them to manually change the git clone URLs to the latest tested versions.
