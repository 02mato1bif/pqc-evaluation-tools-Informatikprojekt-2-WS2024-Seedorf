## Overview

**(Pre-Release Version 0.1.0-Alpha)**

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an expanding field which aims to address the security concerns that quantum computers will bring to current cryptographic technologies. Numerous PQC schemes have been proposed to help combat this concern, with each offering differing solutions. 

This repository provides tools that will simplify the process for the gathering and parsing of PQC computational performance data. It includes scripts that will automate the building process, the testing process, and the result parsing process. The final output from these tools is CSV files, containing performance metrics alongside metric averages that can be further used for graph generation. Jupyter notebook code is also contained in the library, for data visualisation. For more information on the tools, please refer to the [Repository Structure](#repository-structure) section.

> Disclaimer - This is an early version of the project, functionality is limited to x86 Linux devices and Raspberry Pi's. However, future updates will address this issue.

## Installation Instructions

Clone the current stable version:
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/crt26/pqc-eval-tools.git
```

Move into the cloned repository directory and execute the setup script:
```
cd pqc-eval-tools
./setup
```

You may need to change the permissions of the setup script, if that is the case, the setup can be done using the following commands:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### Select which OQS benchmarking libraries should be setup:
When executing the setup script, you will be presented with three options:

1. Build only the Liboqs library (used for only testing PQC performance)

2. Build only the OQS-OpenSSL library (user for only testing PQC TLS performance)

3. Build both the Liboqs and OQS-OpenSSL library (used for testing both PQC performance and PQC in TLS performance)

Based on the option you chose you may be presented with a further option which is to select which version of the Liboqs library is used for PQC performance testing, this will not effect the version of Liboqs which is used with the OQS-OpenSSL testing tools. This options for versions are as follows:

1. Liboqs version 0.7.2
2. Liboqs version 0.8

Once all of the relevant options have been selected, the setup script will download, configure and build each of the libraries. Alongside, optimizing the builds for the current systems by automatically passing the relevant build parameters.

## Automated Testing Tools

### Tools Description
There are two sets of automated testing that can be done using these tools:

- PQC performance benchmarking using Liboqs
- PQC integration into TLS performance benchmarking using OQS-OpenSSL

The testing tools can be found within the `test-scripts` directory and are fully automated. The tools allow multiple machines to be tested, with results being assigned a number set at the beginning of the test. The testing scripts are as follows:

### Liboqs Performance Testing

This script automates the CPU and memory performance benchmarking of various PQC algorithms included in the Liboqs library. It generates and records comprehensive metrics which can help in analysing the performance of these algorithms. 

The test script can be executed using the following command:
```
./full-Liboqs-test.sh
```

#### Detailed usage instructions can be found using the following link:

[Liboqs Performance Automated Testing Instructions](docs/testing-tools-documentation/Liboqs-performance-testing.md)

### OQS-OpenSSL Performance Testing

This script is focused on benchmarking the performance of PQC algorithms when integrated within the OpenSSL (1.1.1) library via OQS. The script firstly can test the computational efficiency of the PQC algorithms when integrated into the OpenSSL library. Alongside, how PQC algorithms perform when integrated into the TLS protocol by measuring empty TLS handshake performance. Furthermore, metrics for how classic algorithms perform when conducting the TLS handshake to gather data which can be used as a baseline to compare the PQC metrics against.   

The testing tool allows for tests to be conducted on a single machine or using two machine connected via a physical network. It should be noted that when using two physical machines the complexity of setup increases.However, regardless of which scenario, the process requires more additional steps then the Liboqs testing.

#### Detailed usage instructions can be found using the following link:

[PQC TLS Performance Automated Testing Instructions](docs/testing-tools-documentation/tls-performance-testing.md)


### Testing Output Files
After selecting the desired testing script, the performance benchmarks will be performed and the unparsed results will be stored in the newly created ``up-results`` directory within the code's root directory. Liboqs unparsed results will be stored in the `up-results/Liboqs/machine-x`* directory. The PQC TLS test results will be stored in the `up-results/Liboqs/machine-x`* directory.

**The machine number assigned to the test*


> **PLEASE NOTE** - Each time the automated tools are activated, all results currently stored in the up-results directory will be deleted. So please move previous results if you intended to execute the automated test tool again.


## Parsing Test Results

### Parsing Overview

The results from the automated tests can be transformed into workable CSV files using the `parse_results.py` script located in the `result-processing/parsing-scripts` directory. Options are provided to parse the Liboqs results, the OQS-OpenSSL results, or both.

The script requires the test parameters used during the benchmarking, including the number of runs and number of machines tested, if multiple machine results have been stored within the `up-results` directory.

> **PLEASE NOTE:** - The parsing script is supported only on machines with `Python 3.10 and above`. For older versions of Python, results can still be parsed using individual scripts. Instructions are provided below.

### Parsing using Python 3.10 and Above <!-- omit from toc --> 

The parsing process, unlike the testing scripts, can be executed on both Linux and Windows machines. If you're parsing results from multiple machines, make sure all results are present in the `up-results` directory. Execute the parsing script with the following command:

```
python parse_results.py
```

### Parsing using Python 3.9 and Below <!-- omit from toc --> 
For machines running an older version of Python, some features within the parse_results.py may not be supported. In this case, results can be manually parsed by executing the relevant script for the desired type of results to be parsed.

**Liboqs Results Parsing:**
```
python Liboqs_parse.py
```

**OQS-OpenSSL Results Parsing**
```
python oqs_openssl_parse.py
```

### Parsed Results Output
At the end of the process, the results will be stored within the newly created **results** directory which can be found in the results folder at the root of the repository. Averages for the results will also be calculated during the parsing process and the average files for the respective test type can be found within the same results directory.

### Graph Generation
Currently the code for automatically is under development and will be included in later versions of the testing suite. However, the results files outputted from the parsing scripts can be used with Microsoft Excel, Python, R-Studio etc. for the creation of graphs. An example Jupyter Notebook, illustrating how this can be done, is included with this version and can be found in the  `result-processing/graph-generators` directory within the code's root directory.
